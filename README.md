# q2kenzieGram
This assessment was a collaboration project completed during the second quarter of the year I was in Kenzie

I was not responsible for the front end code, my teammate Don Moore completed that code. We communicated effectively to ensure front-end and back-end could pass data back and forth effectively. 

My responsibility in this assessment was writing the backend API. I used express as the router, fs to check for existence of local directory to store photos in (creating it if it did not exist), and multer to handle the photo uploads. 

To view this project:
Clone the repo onto your machine
Open two terminals

In terminal 1:
cd into front-end
